# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## DEADLINE - Developer Command Center

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 2025
**Author:** Omer (Ozzy) Akben
**Project:** E-29 Server-side Capstone

---

## 1. Executive Summary

DEADLINE is a web-based command center that consolidates critical developer workflow elements into a single, organized hub. It addresses the fragmentation problem where developers scatter environment variables, code snippets, documentation links, and configuration across multiple tools. By providing a unified platform with environment-aware artifact management, DEADLINE reduces context switching, prevents misconfiguration, and accelerates development workflows.

### Key Value Propositions

- **Unified Hub**: Single source of truth for environment configs, prompts, and documentation
- **Environment Awareness**: First-class support for Dev/Staging/Production separation
- **Security First**: Masked secrets, Firebase authentication, and safe export/import
- **Developer Focused**: Built by developers, for developers' actual workflow needs

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Current State Problems

Developers currently experience significant productivity loss due to:

1. **Configuration Fragmentation**
   - Environment variables scattered across .env files, password managers, and cloud consoles
   - No central visibility into what's configured where
   - High risk of using wrong values in wrong environments

2. **Knowledge Scattering**
   - Documentation bookmarks lost in browser profiles
   - Code snippets buried in gists, Notion pages, or local files
   - AI prompts recreated from scratch each time

3. **Context Switching Overhead**
   - Average developer uses 5-10 different tools for configuration management
   - Each tool has different UI, search, and organization paradigms
   - Mental overhead of remembering where each piece of information lives

4. **Collaboration Friction**
   - Difficult to share configurations safely with team members
   - No audit trail of who changed what configuration when
   - Onboarding new developers requires manual knowledge transfer

### Why Now

- **Multi-environment deployments** are now standard (Dev/Staging/Prod minimum)
- **AI-assisted development** requires reusable, refined prompts
- **Remote work** increases need for centralized, accessible configuration
- **Security incidents** from leaked secrets demand better secret management

---

## 3. Vision & Objectives

### Product Vision

To become the essential command center for every developer's daily workflow, eliminating configuration chaos and accelerating development velocity through intelligent organization and environment awareness.

### Success Criteria

- **Primary**: 50% reduction in time spent managing configurations
- **Secondary**: Zero configuration-related production incidents
- **Tertiary**: 90% of daily-used artifacts accessible within 3 clicks

### Business Objectives

1. **Short-term (3 months)**: Successful capstone project completion
2. **Mid-term (6 months)**: 100 active developer users
3. **Long-term (12 months)**: Open-source release with community contributions
